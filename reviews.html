      <p>Our 4 family adult group really enjoyed our visit to Amuay Wildlife Park. we had a great time exploring the wildlife.
          Our guide was a very passionate man with a great depth of knowledge of Venezulan wildlife and history.
          We appreciated the pace of the tour, the vehicles were comfortable and his instructions were excellent.
          Highly recommended taking this tour.</p>

          <p>Brilliant wildlife park!<br>
            Thisâ€™s a lovely natural park with good enclosures and beautiful lake area. When we were there they were creating a new enclosure ready to welcome some new primates.
            You can tell a lot of work goes into making this a nice place to visit and also for the animals (many of which could roam free). Highly recommended!</p>

          <p>It is one of the finest Park I have seen. The variety of animals have been accommodated in natural habitat to
              keep them healthy &amp; good mood. The team who took us around is doing an excellent work. They are professionally
              dedicated to the project. The park needs full support. I commend their efforts.</p>
