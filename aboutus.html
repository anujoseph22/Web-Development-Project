                  <p>The vision of the Amuay wildlife park is to create an opportunity to the citizens - specially to Young and Rich of Venezuela City to have a
                    Biological Recreation Center very close to the city in the midst of the forests in the valley .To accomplish this vision, a mini zoo was created
                    in 2000 which gradually grown into the present Amuay wildlife park by 2002. With the creation of Amuay wildlife park, the vision was enlarged to
                    meet the ever growing demands of the Venezuelans/ tourists from outside for recreation/ education of younger generations; and also to create
                    awareness on the importance of conservation of flora and fauna - the biodiversity of the nature for the benefit of the future generation in
                    addition to the conservation of the gene pool of the endangered species of wild animals of the region/country</p>

                    <p>Venezuela is home to an enormous variety of animals and plants, and is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. The evolution of the
            country's flora and fauna was the result of two principal factors: the diversity of the landscape, which facilitated the development of numerous,
             distinct habitats, and the natural history of the continent.The plant life of Venezuela is as diverse as its wildlife, ranging from the cacti of
             the desert to the epiphytes of the rainforest. Flora of cultural significance includes the moriche palm, which grows in the swamps
              of the Orinoco delta. Known as the 'tree of life', the moriche plays an essential role in the existence of the Warao Indians,
              providing food and materials for their daily life.</p>

                       (the world's 5th highest total) are endemic to the country.Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species,
