    </div> <br></br>
    <p style="color: white";>It is an enclosure covering over an area of 68.00 in Amuay wildlife. It is believed that the Herbivores Safari
                            was developed during 1970's but opened to public view during 2002. The entire area has been barricaded with stone wall along
                            with the additional support of solar power fence and Elephant proof trench (EPT). The vegetation in the safari is more favourable
                            to the herbivore animals round the year as large number of fodder species like bamboo and anogassius intermitted with vast extent
                            of foreshore area of the water bodies. The edible grass species such as sacharam, symbopogan and heteropogan are commonly seen in
                            the grass land and constitute as the main fodder. Few patches of shorea telura also found within the safari and serving as the
                            standing shade for the animals. These water bodies are remaines perennial and serve as the source of water for the inmate animals
                            during all the seasons.</p> <br></br>

      <p style="color: white";>A walking safari is a wonderful way to explore Amuay wildlife. Walking safaris can vary from gentle morning rambles to a day's hike to another camp, normally a mobile camp.
                              Experiencing Amuay's wilderness areas is integral to most of our trips, and there's no better way than on foot. Walking safaris in Venezula are completely different to game drives;
                              being on foot brings about a totally new way of understanding your surroundings. Walking safaris were the original safari and remain the purest form. Away from the comfort of the 4WD
                              safari vehicle your senses suddenly awaken as the bush becomes more ‘real’. Meeting animals on their terms as a participant in their world can be far more rewarding than just spectating.
                              Your safari guide will usually identify tracks; highlight interesting insects; talk about fascinating plants; and discuss the ecosystem in general – as well as sometimes tracking some of the larger animals.
                              It’s a great way to appreciate the smaller wildlife, which can’t be so easily seen from a vehicle, as well as to experience the buzz of being out with the big game.
                              The precise forms of these vary considerably between the reserves and camps. The scenery, group size, and the quality and likelihood of encountering big game plays a part –
                              but by far the most important factor in your experience is the guide. We know many of the continent’s best walking safari guides; speak to one of our experts about the best way to incorporate walking safaris into your trip</p>
